Invited Talks

 <br>
Tilte: Proof Theory and Complexity <br>
 <br>
This talk will describe some joint work with my student <br>
G. Ostrin, on the proof theory of low subrecursive classes. <br>
The basis is "A new recursion theoretic characterization of <br>
the polytime functions" by Bellantoni and Cook (1992), in  <br>
which it is shown that a natural two-sorted re-interpretation <br>
of the normal primitive recursion schemes characterizes  <br>
polynomially bounded computation. We show that if Peano  <br>
Arithmetic is instead formulated in this two-sorted fashion, <br>
with quantification allowed only over one sort (the "safe" <br>
variables) and induction allowed only over the other ("normal" <br>
variables), then the provably computable functions are exactly <br>
the Kalmar elementary functions E(3). The provably computable  <br>
functions of the Sigma_n Inductive fragments of the theory  <br>
turn out to be closely related to the levels of Ritchie's <br>
hierarchy of "Predictably computable functions" (1963), with <br>
Sigma_1 Induction corresponding to the linear space functions <br>
E(2). This work is related to other results of Buss, Bellantoni, <br>
Beckmann and Leivant, but in addition it clearly illustrates  <br>
the use of classical ordinal analysis techniques at this low level. <br>
The difference with classical Peano Arithmetic is that it is now  <br>
the Slow Growing Hierarchy which supplies the bounding functions, <br>
rather than the Fast Growing Hierarchy which arises in the classical <br>
case. <br>

Title: Sharp bounds for the lengths of reduction sequences in Goedel's T <br>
 <br>
Abstract: Using ideas from infinitary proof theory and based on Howard's <br>
weak normalization proof for Goedel's system T we define <br>
a numbertheoretic function f such that for two given terms <br>
a and b of T the following holds: <br>
If a rewrites to b then f(a) is strictly larger than f(b).  <br>
f ensures termination of T and, in addition, <br>
it yields optimal upper bounds for the lengths of <br>
reductions in Goedel's T. <br>
