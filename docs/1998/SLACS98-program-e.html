   A semantics of Kashima's connection calculus for the logic of constant domain
<p>
By giving an interpretation for Kashima's method of sequents with connections
and using Schuette's method, this talk proves that Kashima's system is cut-free
and that it is complete for some subordination frame.

   Graph-theoretic characterizations of proof nets in non-commutative linear
	logics and their computational complexity
<p>
This talk presents much simpler correctness criteria with no use of the
Danos-Regnier switching condition and proves the corresponding sequentialization
theorems for two multiplicative non-commutative Linear Logics, Cyclic Linear
Logic and Abrusci's non-commutative Linear Logic. As corollaries to the
theorems, we show that typability problems in the Multiplicative non-commutative
Linear Logics are in linear time.

   Multiplicative / Additive Connectives for Deontic Logic

into deontic logic. It also studies some concrete examples in which it is
relevant to distinguish multiplicative from additive.

   About fuzzy equivalence relations
<p>
The basic concepts of fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations have been shown (by the
author) to be most naturally interpreted in the cumulative model of
intuitionistic set theory, where the truth value set is a complete Heyting
algebra. In this talk similar natural interpretation will be presented about
fuzzy equivalence relations and related concepts.

   On Temporal Linear Logic and Timed Petri Net
<p>
In these days, Petri nets have been extended with time. For example, transitions
are arranged by the delay in the firing. They are called timed Petri nets. The
reachability to a marking from another marking corresponds to the provability of
a sequent in linear logic. By introducing discrete time to linear logic, we
represent temporal linear logic and state the correspondence to timed Petri net.

   Observing Reactive Systems: A Logical Approach using Intuitionistic Modal
	Logic
<p>
 A variety of classical modal/temporal logics have been used for specification
and verification of reactive systems. In contrast, there are few applications of
intuitionistic modal logics to computer science.
<br>
 In this talk, the possibility and the feasibility of using intuitionistic modal
logic (IML) into specification of the observed computations ,as sequences of
events, of reactive systems (such as error-loggers and meta control systems) are
discussed.
<br>
  We show that, using IML, subsequences of the ongoing computation which satisfy
certain properties can be explicitly mentioned as instances of the properties
using IML formulas. It is also shown that double negated formulas can be used to
specify the whole computation.

   An Axiomatics for Categories of Transition Systems as Coalgebras
<p>
We consider the categories of transition systems and functinal bisimulations,
which is given as a category of coalgebras for finite-powerset functor on
Set. This category is complete and cocomplete, and has symmetric monoidal closed
structures and a subobject classifier. Most of these properties are implied
axiomatically by the structures of both base category and endofunctor. We give
examples of symmetric monoidal closed structures on the category of labelled
transition systems and an overview of subobject classifier in the category of
transition systems.

   A concurrent call-by-value lambda evaluator based on computational
	interpretation of Linear Logic
<p>
Corresponding to cut-elimination in Classical Linear Logic, Abramsky proposed a
computational system which consists of proof expressions and Linear CHemical
Abstract Machine (CHAM). By Girard's embedding of Intuitionistic Logic into
Linear Logic, typed lambda calculus is embedded into this system. We show that
Linear CHAM can perform reductions of proof expressions which correspond to the
call-by-value lambda evaluation. Since reductions of Linear CHAM can be
performed in parallel, we can design a concurrent call-by-value lambda
evaluator.

   2nd Order Lambda-Mu-Calculus of Call-by-Value
<p>
We introduce an explicitly typed lambda-mu-calculus of call-by-value as a
short-hand for the complete 2nd order Church-style.  Our motivation comes from
the observation that in Curry-style polymorphic calculi, control operators such
as callcc or mu-operators cannot, in general, treat the left contexts correctly. 
It is shown that the CPS-translation is sound with respect to lambda 2 (the
System F of Girard).  As one of by-products, it can be obtained that the 2nd
order lambda-mu-calculus of call-by-value has the strong normalization property.

   A simple proof of the strong normalizability of classical catch/throw

We interpret a classical logic version of Nakano's catch/throw calculus and also
Sato's classical catch/throw calculus into a variant of Parigot's lambda-mu-
calculus. By using this interpretation, we give a simple proof of the strong
normalizability of these calculi.

   Kolmogorov complexity and fractal sets
<p>
 kolmogorov complexity denotes the auxiliary information content which is
required for generating a given object by an algorithm.
<br>
 We represent any point in Euclidean space in base-two notation and consider the
rate of information compression by means of Kolmogorov complexity. We show that
the maximum value of all such rates of information compression is equal to the
Hausdorff dimension for each set in a certain class of self-similar sets which
includes familiar fractal sets, Cantor set, Koch curve, Sierpinski gasket, and
so on. And also we introduce Omega^D which is a generalization of Chaitin's
halting probability Omega. Studying its properties, we show that the Hausdorff
dimension of the self-similar set related to the halting problem is equal to 1.

   Computability of the Hausdorff Metrics on Computable Metric Spaces
<p>
It is known that all nonempty compact subsets of a metric space form a metric
space with the Hausdorff metric. Weihrauch has defined a "computable metric
space" as a metric space with an enumarated dense subset. We will show that all
nonempty compact subsets of a computable metric space can form a computable
metric space.  We will also show some applications.

   Uniform Continuity of Graph Model and Partial Function Model
<p>
The uniform continuity property MCONT for a partial combinatory algebra with
pairing and natural numbers is that there exists a functional which uniformly
produces from a type 2 functional its associate in the finite type structure on
the algebras.  This talk shows that either the the partial function model or the
graph model does not have MCONT.

   A realizability interpretation of self-referential types
<p>
It is well known that type definitions with negative self-references introduce a
contradiction so called Russell's paradox. We propose a cost conscious typing
system and its realizability interpretation which gives a natural semantics to
such paradoxical types. We also show that this typing system gives a good
axiomatic semantics to fixed point combinators, such as Y, so that we can
construct recursive programs using fixed point combinators taking account only
of their types.

   Beeson's q-realizability is useful for program extraction
<p>
Beeson introduced a q-realizability interpretation to prove existence property
for some constructive formal theory with set notions(IZF, T_0, etc). It used a
technique of "doubling variables". Tatsuta introduced "set completion"
q-realizability interpretation and showed it could be a substitue of Beeson's
for particular formalizations of Feferman's T_0. Then, he claimed that "doubling
variable" interpretation is not adequate for program extraction" but his one is.
We will show "doubling variables" technique is adequate for program extraction
contrary to the claim.
